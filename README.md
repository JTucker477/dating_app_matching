# Dating App Matching Algorithm

Created a matching algorithm that has a reputation system against catfishing. When simulated, the matching system acheives a sort of equilibirum between users 
and the reputation system in which it's good for users to catfish a little bit but not so much to the point where the reputation system will kick them out. To see
all of the results and analysis, check out "Final Project.pdf".
